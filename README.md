  <i>A collection of nostalgic Flash games from the 2010s, preserved and made playable in modern browsers.</i>
</p>

## üìñ About This Project

This repository contains a collection of classic Flash games created by Antoine Boucher in 2010 for Parascholar at Sainte College. These games represent a piece of web history and personal nostalgia from a time when Flash games dominated online entertainment.

Thanks to the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) emulator, these games remain playable even after Adobe Flash's end-of-life in December 2020.

### How Ruffle Works

Ruffle is a Flash Player emulator written in Rust that translates Flash ActionScript to JavaScript on the fly. This project embeds Ruffle directly, so no plugins or extensions are required to play these games.
