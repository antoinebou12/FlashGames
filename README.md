## Usage with Ruffle

To ensure these games remain playable even after the discontinuation of Flash, this repository utilizes [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/), a Flash Player emulator. Thanks to Ruffle, you can play these games in any modern browser without any additional plugins.

To try out Ruffle, visit the [official web demo page](https://ruffle.rs/demo/).
